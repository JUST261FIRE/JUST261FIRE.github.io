As any other commercial organisation Angel Travel of Oundle Ltd and Angel Cars of Oundle has a set of terms and conditions which govern the way we do business. These are set out below and we must ask you to note that these, and only these, terms and conditions will apply. It is a part of your contract with us that you agree to them.

The following conditions apply whether or not a contract of carriage has been entered into as a quotation being offered and accepted or whether a contract has been made verbally or in writing.

Angel Travel of Oundle Ltd and Angel Cars of Oundle is hereafter referred to as The Company <p>
	
</p>

1. Vehicles are hired subject to availability at time of receipt of order. <br>
2.In the event of national emergency or Force Majeure or any unforeseen circumstances or unavoidable shortage of drivers or coaches, the company reserves the right to cancel any booking without liability to the Hirer.<br>
3.The right is reserved to sub-contract a vehicle from another coach operator without notice to the Hirer.<br>
4.Vehicles must not be sub-let, lent or licensed by a Hirer to another coach operator.<br>
5.Seating capacity and type of coach are not necessarily indicative of the size or facilities of the vehicle supplied. Every effort will be made to supply vehicles with facilities or seating as shown or advised, but they cannot be guaranteed to be available on the day of the journey. Where the Company supplies a vehicle of greater capacity than that contracted, the Company reserves the right to levy an additional charge if the extra seating capacity is utilised by the hirer.<br>
6.Refreshments may be consumed on the coach at the sole discretion of the Driver.  Hot food must never be consumed or carried on the vehicle. Where permission is granted it will be on the condition that no damage is caused and adequate provision is made to remove any ensuing rubbish. Alcohol is not permitted by law to be carried or drunk when travelling to or from specified sporting events. Glass utensils must not be used whilst the vehicle is in motion. The company reserves the right to charge between £10.00 and £45.00 per liquid spillage.  The higher charge will be applicable for alcoholic spillages.
7.Personal effects and luggage are carried at owners risk. The gangway and emergency exits must remain unobstructed at all times. The person appointed by the Hirer to be in charge of the party shall ensure the correct number of cases are taken onto the coach and are taken off at the destination. Every effort will be made to accommodate additional items where possible. Any bulky items must be advised to us at least 48 hours before departure. Please refer to our coach hire department for guidelines. The Company will not accept any responsibility for any loss or damage to property whilst on the coach. Child seats / booster seats can be used where supplied by the Hirer.  It is the Hirers sole responsibility to ensure such items are fitted to the seats correctly and must be removed from the seat by the Hirer at the destination.  The Company may (when agreed beforehand) agree to store such items on condition that the Company takes no responsibility for loss or damage whilst in storage. The Hirer is strongly recommended to supply a dust and damp proof cover for the items to protect them against environmental contamination whilst in storage<br>.
8.The driver is responsible for the safety of the vehicle. Any passenger whose conduct is in breach of statutory regulations may be removed on the driver’s authority.

The Company reserves the right to curtail or otherwise amend any hire which does not comply with the relevant regulations. Any deviations to the route must be agreed with our Coach Hire department before the journey commences. Any additional time or mileage will be charged extra.<br>
12.In case a vehicle is required during the time a coach is at a destination the right is reserved to withdraw the vehicle to undertake another journey.
